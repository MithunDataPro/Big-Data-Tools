## Why Should I Use Azure HDInsight?

| Capability           | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cloud native**     | Azure HDInsight enables you to create optimized clusters for Spark, Interactive Query (LLAP), Kafka, HBase, and Hadoop on Azure. HDInsight also provides an end-to-end SLA on all your production workloads. |
| **Low-cost and scalable** | HDInsight enables you to scale workloads up or down. You can reduce costs by creating clusters on demand and paying only for what you use. You can also build data pipelines to operationalize your jobs. Decoupled compute and storage provide better performance and flexibility. |
| **Secure and compliant** | HDInsight enables you to protect your enterprise data assets with Azure Virtual Network, encryption, and integration with Microsoft Entra ID. HDInsight also meets the most popular industry and government compliance standards. |
| **Monitoring**       | Azure HDInsight integrates with Azure Monitor logs to provide a single interface with which you can monitor all your clusters. |
| **Global availability** | HDInsight is available in more regions than any other big data analytics offering. Azure HDInsight is also available in Azure Government, China, and Germany, which allows you to meet your enterprise needs in key sovereign areas. |
| **Productivity**     | Azure HDInsight enables you to use rich productive tools for Hadoop and Spark with your preferred development environments. These development environments include Visual Studio, VS Code, Eclipse, and IntelliJ for Scala, Python, Java, and .NET support. |
| **Extensibility**    | You can extend the HDInsight clusters with installed components (Hue, Presto, and so on) by using script actions, by adding edge nodes, or by integrating with other big data certified applications. HDInsight enables seamless integration with the most popular big data solutions with a one-click deployment. |

## Cluster Types in HDInsight

HDInsight includes specific cluster types and cluster customization capabilities, such as the ability to add components, utilities, and languages. HDInsight offers the following cluster types:

| Cluster Type              | Description                                                                                                                                             | Get Started                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Apache Hadoop**         | A framework that uses HDFS, YARN resource management, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data in parallel.            | [Create an Apache Hadoop cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters) |
| **Apache Spark**          | An open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications.             | [Create an Apache Spark cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-overview)         |
| **Apache HBase**          | A NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data--potentially billions of rows times millions of columns. | [Create an Apache HBase cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hbase-overview)                |
| **Apache Interactive Query** | In-memory caching for interactive and faster Hive queries.                                                                                               | [Create an Interactive Query cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-interactive-query-overview) |
| **Apache Kafka**          | An open-source platform used for building streaming data pipelines and applications. Kafka also provides message-queue functionality that allows you to publish and subscribe to data streams. | [Create an Apache Kafka cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-kafka-overview)          |
